<h2>It's official</h2>
<p> Kai Green has returned to competition conditioning,
took to the finals stage, and destroyed the competition
after a rocky start. Kai Green is back doing what he loves.
Greene, who also won the Arnold Classic in 2009 and 2010, joins five-time winner Dexter Jackson, four-time champ Flex Wheeler and three-time winner Jay Cutler as the only men with more than two Arnold Classic trophies.
Greene received congratulations from Arnold Schwarzenegger, a check for $130,000, a Tony Nowak Official Champions Jacket and the champion’s trophy from Eric Hillman of Europa Sports Products and Eric Torgeson of EAS.</p>
